Template suggestion:

pros:
- a small project with a simple handshake logic
- has at least one test :)
- Implementing tokio crate and asynchronous programming is recommended for writing reliable network applications without compromising speed.


cons:
- no git tree!
- There are some code style/formatting issues - It's recommended to run  `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to get proper list of issues.
- There are some code warnings - It's recommended to run  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` to obtain proper list of warnings. Please see an example below:
```dotenv
error: this expression creates a reference which is immediately dereferenced by the compiler
   --> src/main.rs:132:33
    |
132 |     let receiver = Address::new(&receiver_address, SERVICES);
    |                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ help: change this to: `receiver_address`
    |
    = help: for further information visit https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#needless_borrow
    = note: `-D clippy::needless-borrow` implied by `-D warnings`
    = help: to override `-D warnings` add `#[allow(clippy::needless_borrow)]`
```
- Lack of .gitignore file - (*eg. It's recommended to ignore some files that are not required in the git repo - e.g. files generated by Cargo in the `/target` folder or others*) 
- `#![allow(unused)]` -  `src/main.rs line: 1` - By adding this line, we are preventing to get warnings (*if any*) related to dead code or unused variables. Suggestion here: Remove this line and then run  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` to validate the code.
- Functions and variables are not properly documented/commented, so it becomes hard to follow in some cases. Even though comments can become outdated and misleading over time, they help to provide context, explain complex logic, and guide future developers. 
- Modify `perform_handshake` function signature to also receive **local_address** variable by reference.
- Refactor main.rs and create a *new* errors module (see: `errors.rs`) - this is recommended to list errors and can also be reused by other modules.
- Refactor main.rs and create a *new* trace log module (see: `trace_log.rs`) - this is recommended to encapsulate tracing functionality.
- `VersionMessage` struct parameters like **USER_AGENT** and **START_HEIGHT** are hardcoded. It's recommended to move these values to .env file and handle them via a configuration functionality (see: `config.rs`)
- Refactor main.rs and create a *new* network module (see: `network.rs`) - this is recommended to encapsulate network features.
-  Lack of unit tests to validate individual parts of the program behave as expected (*e.g. `connect`, `perform_handshake`*). It's recommended to also include tests that intentionally uses incorrect data to verify the robustness of the code.
-  Whenever is possible, update dependencies in `Cargo.toml` to the latests recommended version (*sometimes this is not possible due to backwards compatibility issues with existing code*)
